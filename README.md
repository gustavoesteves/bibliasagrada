# Angular default Login project
Default Angular, ASP.NET core, Identity Framework and SQLServer.

Builded with the most responsive and used tools on the market, Default Login is a substitute for Hazor default Visual Studio front-end.

This App helps us get a start with a Login and management account user. We used some technologies like Angular, Typescript, Bootstrap to name few.

The back-end (Rest API), we used ASP.Net, C# and SQLServer to manage the requests.
